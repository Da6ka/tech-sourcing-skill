# linkedin-sourcing-skill

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skill for LinkedIn candidate sourcing — turns a job description or briefing into a candidate persona, finds matching LinkedIn profiles, scores them, and drafts personalized outreach in one pass.

## What it does

When triggered (e.g. by pasting a JD, asking to "find candidates", "source for this role", or "write outreach"), the skill walks through a full sourcing workflow:

1. Synthesizes the role/briefing into a candidate persona
2. Finds real LinkedIn profiles via web search
3. Scores candidates against the persona
4. Drafts personalized outreach messages

See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for the full instructions, and [references/](references/) for the boolean search guide and outreach examples used by the skill.

## Install

Copy this folder into your Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Da6ka/linkedin-sourcing-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/linkedin-sourcing
```

Restart Claude Code (or start a new session) and the skill will be available automatically — Claude triggers it when you paste a JD or ask to source/outreach on LinkedIn.


## Avoiding LinkedIn account restrictions

LinkedIn monitors for automated or bot-like behavior. To keep your account safe while using this skill, follow these precautions:

**Use it moderately and naturally.** Avoid running large-scale or repetitive tasks in a short period (e.g., sending hundreds of connection requests or messages in one session).

**Don't violate LinkedIn's Terms of Service.** The skill operates your browser just like a human would — it clicks, types, and navigates. However, LinkedIn still prohibits automated scraping and mass actions.

**Avoid high-volume actions in bulk.** Sending many connection requests, messages, or profile views in rapid succession are the most common triggers for restrictions. Keep volumes low and space out such actions.

**Don't scrape or export data at scale.** Extracting large amounts of profile data, contact lists, or company information is a primary reason LinkedIn blocks accounts. Use the skill only for targeted, purposeful lookups.

**Keep sessions realistic.** Very long uninterrupted sessions with constant activity can look suspicious. Stick to focused, human-scale tasks.

**Respect CAPTCHAs.** If LinkedIn presents a CAPTCHA or verification challenge, the skill will stop and let you handle it yourself — this is by design and protects your account.

As long as you use this skill for reasonable, human-scale tasks (researching a specific candidate, sending a message, reviewing a profile), your account should stay safe.
