# linkedin-sourcing-skill

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skill for LinkedIn candidate sourcing — turns a job description or briefing into a candidate persona, finds matching LinkedIn profiles, scores them, and drafts personalized outreach in one pass.

## What it does

When triggered (e.g. by pasting a JD, asking to "find candidates", "source for this role", or "write outreach"), the skill walks through a full sourcing workflow:

1. Synthesizes the role/briefing into a candidate persona
2. Finds real LinkedIn profiles via web search
3. Scores candidates against the persona
4. Drafts personalized outreach messages

See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for the full instructions, and [references/](references/) for the boolean search guide and outreach examples used by the skill.

**Note:** outreach messages, profile tables, and other templates default to English, but the
skill matches whatever language you or the JD are written in; see "Output language" in
`SKILL.md`.

## Install

Copy this folder into your Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Da6ka/linkedin-sourcing-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/linkedin-sourcing
```

Restart Claude Code (or start a new session) and the skill will be available automatically — Claude triggers it when you paste a JD or ask to source/outreach on LinkedIn.


## Avoiding LinkedIn account restrictions

LinkedIn monitors for automated or bot-like behavior. To keep your account safe while using this skill, follow these precautions:

**Use it moderately and naturally.** Avoid running large-scale or repetitive tasks in a short period (e.g., sending hundreds of connection requests or messages in one session).

**Don't violate LinkedIn's Terms of Service.** The skill operates your browser just like a human would — it clicks, types, and navigates. However, LinkedIn still prohibits automated scraping and mass actions.

**Avoid high-volume actions in bulk.** LinkedIn enforces the following limits (as of 2025):

| Action | Free account | Paid account | Safe daily pace |
|---|---|---|---|
| Connection requests | ~80–100/week | ~100/week | 15–20/day |
| Messages to connections | ~100/week | ~150/week | 15–20/day |
| Profile views | 500/day | 2,000/day | Stay under 50% (~250/day free, ~1,000/day paid) |
| Pending unaccepted invites | 2,500 total | 2,500 total | Withdraw old ones regularly |

Sending requests or messages in rapid bursts (even within these caps) can trigger spam filters. Space actions out and avoid running long uninterrupted sessions.

The skill itself caps Cowork profile-visit batches at 15–20 per instruction (see `SKILL.md` Part C) to line up with the "safe daily pace" figures above — if your search turns up more candidates than that, run the Cowork collection step in separate batches rather than all at once.

**Don't scrape or export data at scale.** Extracting large amounts of profile data, contact lists, or company information is a primary reason LinkedIn blocks accounts. Use the skill only for targeted, purposeful lookups.

**Keep sessions realistic.** Very long uninterrupted sessions with constant activity can look suspicious. Stick to focused, human-scale tasks.

**Respect CAPTCHAs.** If LinkedIn presents a CAPTCHA or verification challenge, the skill will stop and let you handle it yourself — this is by design and protects your account.

As long as you use this skill for reasonable, human-scale tasks (researching a specific candidate, sending a message, reviewing a profile), your account should stay safe.
